# Data Vision Platform

- We have designed a platform to make it easy for users to navigate data sources from different websites. We added a part for researchers where they can surface the most popular scientific research. Our platform also has a community where users can post about global problems and do different activities related to data.

- The home page displays a search button to navigate any dataset using a keyword but due to not our access to many datasets we integrated our website with the popular website **DATA.GOV** so that when the user enters a keyword in the home page, he gets the results in **DATA.GOV** website. It may be not the professional way but it's an idea until we are able to access many datasets.

- We also made a page that displays the most popular data sources around the world in cards that allow the user to go to the website by clicking.
- 
- We designed this website using **React** technology and it must be opened on a live server according to "CORS policy".
